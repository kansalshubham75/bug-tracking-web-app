INTERVIEW:

1) 	You are owner of flower shop, there are 2 types of flowers- Rose and lily. There are 2 types of people flower lovers and flower alergic, flower alergic person donates his

	Implement 4 functions-
	1- buyFlower()
	2- donate()
	3- buyLily()
	4- buuyRose()
	Implment all in O(1) Time  complexity

	HINT- Queue Data Structure;

2) 	Conversion of sorted array to Balanced BST 
	TC- O(n)

3) 	Given an infinite stream of numbers, check if at the particular moment a target element k exist in array.
	TC- O( log(n) )

	HINT- Binary search
